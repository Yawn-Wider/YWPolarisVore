<p>===Science Update (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===</p>

<p>More news on the Revenant Society we covered last in June. As of January 7th, at 0453hrs NT Standard Time, the Revenant society has fallen silent. With the shut down of the last combatant, and the departure and subsequent loss of the drone we reported refueling on River's platform, the apparent centuries long war is over. River was noted as lamenting that it was "cheated" out of its victory for its faction by "cruel and merciless time", before promptly heavily encrypting all its files and data, landing its platform at a former spaceport of its makers, and shutting down. The science team was able to make an archival copy of the files post-encryption, and are strategizing with a team of AIs to decrypt the information and code in a reasonable timespan using partial copies made prior to River's shut-down as reference. A number of cyborg and android teams have also been deployed to search the ruins for historical archives, media, and other such materials that may have survived the conflict. As a result of these events, the now silent world in the [CLASSIFIED] system has become an even more chilling reminder of the cost of war.</p>

<p>===Obituary [Ted Polkins 2500 - 2565] (Sylvanus Colony Outlet)===</p>

<p>Ted Polkins passed away peacefully in his home two days ago surrounded by friends. He was sixty-five. Ted is not survived by any living family. He will be remembered as an eccentric man with many tales and just as many ideas. Suddenly onset by a mysterious illness that modern medicine could not identify, he passed away shortly after with what many would call a sharp decline in mental health. He is is to be buried in a cave outside the colony that he stated in his will was his 'favorite place in the galaxy'. Colony Administration advises that in respect of Ted people visit briefly and leave the area as they found it. Anyone with concerns about Teds remarks before his death are to be directed to the medical team for checkups. May Ted rest in peace.</p>
<p>[In lieu of flowers the Colony Administration requests that donations be made to the Medical Office in Teds Memory. If you would like to plant a tree in the field next to Ted's Cave you may inquire with the Administration. Ted was not Mad and any remarks that were disturbing should be talked about with a Psychiatrist of the Medical Team.]</p>

<p>===The Probe again! (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===</p>

<p>After a long period of no news, the probes we reported on last in July of last year, have been spotted again. This time, shots were exchanged between one of the mysterious vessels and the Argora colony defense vessel Tripoli. No casualties were reported, but sensor data recovered from the exchange may lead to new insights on the strange appearances of the probes. Procedures for the release of the data to Nanotrasen®™ specialists are underway.</p>

<p>===SCIENCE UPDATE! (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===</p>

<p>In a bit of interesting science news, stellar cartography crews have discovered a planet that appears to have suffered a partial ecological collapse at the hands of now extinct digital-age inhabitants. Astonishingly, sensor readings and high-resolution satellite imaging suggests the planet is now being repopulated by a feudal society of pocket-sized mammals mutated in the wake of the previous local sapients' downfall. Current analysis shows this new feudal society to have developed a mastery of gunpowder, and they even appear to be undertaking early experimentation with electricity. For exo-ecological reasons, the coordinates and location of the system in question will not be added to public star charts.</p>

<p>===FIRST CONTATACT UPDATE: Atomic Edition (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===</p>

<p>A new culture has been brought into the fold of Galactic Commerce by a Nanotrasen®™ scouting fleet. The group, physically resembling humanoid asian tapirs (Terran Acrocodia indica), call them selves the Eltoo, and are the latest in a list of cultures found in the wake of a self-inflicted armageddon, this one nuclear. They were discovered when the scouting fleet detected high concentrations of phoron in their planet's crust. Investigation followed, and found the group, living amongst the rubble of their former civilization some 200 years after its destruction, mining and trading phoron as a fuel source. Linguistic AIs were employed to study the primary Eltoo language and first contact was made shortly after with the largest thriving faction. Negotiations regarding uplifting the Eltoo, and relief efforts in exchange for access to their phoron deposits are on-going.</p>

<p>===Mysterious Vessel Appears in Nanotrasen-owned space. Colony Faces Unidentified Species===</p>

<p>In an unprecedented turn of events, a mysterious vessel has inexplicably teleported within Nanotrasen-owned space. The circumstances surrounding its arrival remain shrouded in mystery as Nanotrasen authorities scramble to uncover the identity and intentions of the enigmatic newcomers.</p>

<p>The vessel materialized through a Bluespace anomaly, coinciding with the activation of a damaged bluespace drive on another vessel, suspected to have been targeted in a pirate attack. The whereabouts and fate of the second vessel remain unknown, intensifying the intrigue surrounding the incident.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing development, we will update this page as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>5-16-2567</p>
<p>Initial attempts to communicate with the newly arrived species have proven challenging due to a complete language barrier. Neither side understands the other's native tongue, hindering immediate understanding and raising questions about the origins of the unidentified species.</p>

<p>5-20-2567</p>
<p>Some members of two species from the mysterious vessel have stepped forward, displaying a willingness to cooperate and work alongside Nanotrasen personnel, which we have learned from a good source was when money was mentionned and understood.. The first species, known as the Kig-Yar, possesses reptilian features, while the second species, the T'vaoan, displays more avian characteristics. These beings, seemingly related, have exhibited unique skills and abilities that have caught the attention of Nanotrasen officials.</p>

<p>Linguists and scientists within Nanotrasen are working tirelessly to establish means of communication with the two identified species. We have also learned there are four species aboard the ship that have been seen so far. Efforts are underway to teach them the common language in the hopes of bridging the communication gap.</p>

<p>6-1-2567</p>
<p>Nanotrasen has cleared two of the species that seems to have branched off from the ship to work on the Cryogaia installation, in a press brief, they thanked language implants they pioneered for helping with the process of teaching them galcom. The remaining species on the ship have not shown interest in receiving help and seems to be trying to repair their own ship.</p>

<p>6-3-2567</p>
<p>A first shipment of humanitarian aid has been delivered to the ship, we have learned that it is named the "Consideration" and that its crew are trying to leave back to their own system, but it has not moved from its position since first contact.</p>

Despite the looming danger of colliding debris and potential damage to their own ship, the team demonstrated extraordinary skill and teamwork in successfully extracting both the NSV Odyssey and the SST Horizon from the perilous situation.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of the mission was the successful rescue of a crewmember trapped in a cryopod aboard the SST Horizon. The individual, whose identity is being kept confidential, had been isolated and in danger of being lost forever in the cold void of space. The NanoTrasen team, however, executed a flawless operation to safely retrieve and revive the crewmember, earning them accolades for their quick thinking and decisive actions.</p>

<p>In recognition of their exceptional bravery and professionalism, NanoTrasen has awarded each member of the salvage and rescue team a Medal of Achievement. The medals were sent to the crewmember's habitats through Major Bill shipping.</p>

<p>The awarded team members have become shining examples of NanoTrasen's dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration and ensuring the safety of those who embark on the perilous journey into the cosmos.</p>

<p>===Cryogaia Crew Defeats Menacing Gygax Mech with Innovative Durand Creation===</p>

<p>In a dramatic clash in the far reaches of space, the crew of the Cryogaia Colony, owned by NanoTrasen, successfully thwarted a deadly Gygax mech, owned by a rival company, that threatened their survival. After losing several members to the mechanical menace, a scientist of the crew devised a strategic plan that culminated in the creation of a powerful mech known as the Durand.</p>

<p>The incident unfolded when the Gygax mech took the life of one of the colony's pathfinder. Despite the crew's valiant efforts to retrieve the body, the Gygax proved to be a formidable adversary, resulting in the loss of multiple lives</p>

<p>Recognizing the urgent need for a countermeasure, the science department worked to construct the Durand, a cutting-edge mech equipped with advanced weaponry and defensive systems. The showdown between Durand and Gygax within the colony's confines was tense, but ultimately, the Durand emerged victorious, delivering a decisive blow that neutralized the threat.</p>

<p>NanoTrasen has commended the crew's bravery, pledging ongoing support for the colony's recovery. The Cryogaia Colony now stands as a testament to human resilience, showcasing that even in the depths of space, our determination and innovation can overcome the most formidable challenges.</p>
